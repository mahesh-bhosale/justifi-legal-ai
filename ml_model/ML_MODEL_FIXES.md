# ML Model Fixes Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Device Handling Conflict
**Problem**: `model.to(device)` was called after `device_map="auto"` which caused conflicts
**Solution**: Restructured the model loading to handle CPU and GPU cases separately before loading the model

### 2. Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: `bitsandbytes` and `accelerate` were missing from requirements.txt
**Solution**: Added the missing dependencies to requirements.txt

### 3. Import Issues
**Problem**: Route files and other modules had incorrect import paths
**Solution**: Fixed all imports to use proper relative imports (e.g., `from ..config import`)

### 4. Quantization Configuration Mismatch
**Problem**: config.py had QUANTIZATION_BITS=8 but model_loader.py was using 4-bit quantization
**Solution**: Updated config.py to use 4-bit quantization to match the actual implementation

### 5. Error Handling and Logging
**Problem**: Limited error handling and no proper logging
**Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the codebase

## Files Modified

- `model_loader.py` - Fixed device handling, added error handling and logging
- `requirements.txt` - Added missing dependencies
- `config.py` - Fixed quantization bits configuration
- `main.py` - Fixed import paths
- `routes/summarize_routes.py` - Fixed import paths
- `routes/ask_routes.py` - Fixed import paths
- `qa.py` - Fixed import paths
- `summarizer.py` - Fixed import paths
- `run_local_gpu.py` - Fixed import paths

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Device Management**: Proper handling of CPU vs GPU model loading
2. **Robust Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
3. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
4. **Consistent Imports**: All relative imports are now correct
5. **Dependency Management**: All required packages are listed in requirements.txt

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all fixes:
```bash
cd ml_model
python test_fixes.py
```

## Usage

The ML model can now be run with:
```bash
cd ml_model/ml_model
python main.py
```

Or with ngrok for public access:
```bash
python run_local_gpu.py
```
